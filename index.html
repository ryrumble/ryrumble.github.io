    <!--hiding cringe content <h3 style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">You have been teleported to an unknown arena. All around you are familiar faces - in fact, you recognize everyone you see. They're you!<br>
      An omnipotent voice clears their throat. You (collectively) are startled, and look around for a source. You understand the voice is not coming from someone around you.<br>
      <span style="font-family: Cormorant; font-size: xx-large;">Become the best you can be, by besting every other version of yourself. There can only be one!</span><br>
      You are again teleported to a waiting room with yourselves.</h3>
    <h3>How bewildering! You check for your things. Wallet, phone, keys... and a second phone? In your other pocket? You reach in and pull it out.</h3>
